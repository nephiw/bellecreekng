## I. Attending
Laurie Tatlock, Mulhern MRE, Inc.; Charles Wolfersberger, Wolfersberger, LLC.  Committee Members: Sabrina Ray, Leonard Sandoval, Jonathan Stanwyck, and Nephi Wright.  Residents:  Peploe Russell and Kevin Klabon.

## II. Covenant Enforcement Matters
The Committee reviewed the violation report and homeowner accounts report with Charles Wolfersberger.

The Committee discussed the request for fine reductions from the Ruth Collins Trust, the owner of 10749 Akron Street.  A fine reduction policy will be considered for adoption at the January meeting.  The Committee will consider this request at that meeting.

The property owner at 9495 East 108th Place discussed the fines and violations at his property with the Committee.  The Committee asked that he repair the fence, remove the debris/trash in the yard and driveway, and submit a plan and schedule for painting and fixing the backyard disrepair.  After the adoption of the fine reduction policy in January, the Committee will consider the request for fine reductions.

The Committee continued to review the Design Guideline revisions.

## III. Resident Comments/Issues
Mr. Russell discussed his concerns with the Committee.  The Committee advised that as these concerns were not covenant enforcement matters, there was nothing that they could do.

## IV. Committee Member Comments/Issues
The Committee asked that staff find out if Rich Brewer was still interested in serving on the Committee.
