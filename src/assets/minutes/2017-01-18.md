Laurie Tatlock, Mulhern MRE, Inc., Charles Wolfersberger, Wolfersberger, LLC.  Committee Member: Nephi Wright

## II. Covenant Enforcement Matters
Laurie Tatlock updated the Committee on the progress filing notices of intent to file legal to the property owners with over $1,000 in violation fines who do not address the violations and continue to accrue fines.

The Committee discussed the request from the resident at 9250 East 107th Place for assistance with a neighborâ€™s dog barking nuisance.  The Committee agreed that it would be difficult for the District to enforce a nuisance violation of the Covenants as we are not staffed to come out and observe 24/7.  It was suggested that they residents a 9250 East 107th Place call Commerce City when the doges are barking and if further action from the District is needed we can call or write to the offending neighbor.

The Committee discussed changing the policy on snow removal violations.

## III. Resident Comments/Issues
None.

## IV. Committee Comments/Issues
The Committee discussed alleyway parking violations and how they can be enforced.
