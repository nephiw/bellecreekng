## I. Attending
Laurie Tatlock, Mulhern MRE, Inc., Charles Wolfersberger, Wolfersberger, LLC.  Committee Members: Nephi Wright, and Sabrina Ray

## II. Covenant Enforcement Matters
Laurie Tatlock explained that the Belle Creek Metropolitan District No. 1 Board of Directors had authorized legal counsel to prepare and send notices of intent to file legal to the property owners with over $1,000 in violation fines who do not address the violations and continue to accrue fines.

The Committee discussed the request from the resident at 9512 East 109th place for a front yard flagpole and fine reduction for backyard weeds.  The Committee agreed to reduce the fines to $25 but did not approve the front yard flagpole since the design guidelines stipulate that flags are to hang from poles mounted on the home.

The Committee discussed the request from the property owner at 9248 East 109th Avenue for a fine reduction.  This owner will be advised that until the violations are cured, the fines cannot be reduced, but when the yard is brought into compliance, they will consider a reduction of fines.

## III. Resident Comments/Issues
None.

## IV. Committee Comments/Issues
None.
