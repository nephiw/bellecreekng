Laurie Tatlock, Mulhern MRE, Inc., Charles Wolfersberger, Wolfersberger, LLC.  Committee Members: Nephi Wright, Leonard Sandoval, and Sabrina Ray

## II. Covenant Enforcement Matters
Charles Wolfersberger explained that he was still waiting for the new color book that will be posted on the District’s website.

The Committee discussed the request from Branden Ledbetter to reduce the fines accrued over the past year for lattice repairs and weeds in the rockbeds.  The fines total over $500.  The committee agreed to a $450 reduction in fines.  

The Committee asked Charles Wolfersberger to send out quarterly statements discussed the status of backyard disrepair/fines at 10570 Dayton Street.  Due to the owner’s illness, the Committee will stop fines on the violations and will consider fine reductions when the violations are cured.

The Committee discussed how they might handle the property owners that do not address the violations and just continue to accrue fines.  Laurie Tatlock will discuss the matter with the Belle Creek Metropolitan District Board at their December 5, 2016 Board Meeting.
